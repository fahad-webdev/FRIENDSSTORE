            What started as a vision between two university friends, Fahad and Hassan, turned into a thriving brand built on passion, perseverance, and ambition. In his second semester, Fahad dreamed of launching an online store to sell high-quality shoes and accessories. With limited resources but unwavering determination, he shared the idea with Hassan, and together, they took a leap of faithâ€”investing their pocket money and savings to kickstart their journey as sellers.
